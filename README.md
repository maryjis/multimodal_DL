# Multimodal deep learning in neuroimaging

The articles related to Multimodal deep learning in neuroimaging are represented in the table. There are collection of articles related to classification task in psychiatry and neurology based on DL methods. In each article some neuroimaging data (sMRI, fMRI, PET, DTI, EEG, MEG, MultiOmics) are fused with eacgh other for improving model predictions. The source code of proposed method is attached if it available.

| Multimodal deep learning models for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease stage  | Alzheimer’s disease classification  |  Data: ADNI Count: 220 patients Modality: MRI,Genetic, Clinic Preprocessing: ART toolbox, extract 3D areas of 21 brain regions (associated with Alzheimer’s disease),Features including the brain volumes, voxel intensities, and texture based features. We extract features such as energy, entropy, and 13 Haralick texture features| 3D CNN + Sparse Denoising autoencoders + Dense network  | 0.8% +- 0.03% acc  |
