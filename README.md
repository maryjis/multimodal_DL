# Multimodal deep learning in neuroimaging

The articles related to Multimodal deep learning in neuroimaging are represented in the table. There are collection of articles related to classification task in psychiatry and neurology based on DL methods. In each article some neuroimaging data (sMRI, fMRI, PET, DTI, EEG, MEG, MultiOmics) are fused with eacgh other for improving model predictions. The source code of proposed method is attached if it available.
